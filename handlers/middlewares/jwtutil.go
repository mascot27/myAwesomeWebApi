good read on json token:
(taken from SO)

Here is the a solution called as JWT old for new exchange schema.

Because we canâ€™t invalidate the issued token before expire time, we always use short-time token, such as 30 minute. When the token expired, we use the old token exchange a new token. The critical point is one old token can exchange one new token only.

In center auth server, we maintain a table like this:

table auth_tokens(
    user_id,
    jwt_hash,
    expire
)

user_id contained in JWT string. jwt_hash is a hash value of whole JWT string,Such as SHA256. expire field is optional.

The following is work flow:

    User request the login API with username and password, the auth server issue one token, and register the token ( add one row in the table. )
    When the token expired, user request the exchange API with the old token. Firstly the auth server validate the old token as normal except expire checking, then create the token hash value, then lookup above table by user id:
        If found record and user_id and jwt_hash is match, then issue new token and update the table.
        If found record, but user_id and jwt_hash is not match , it means someone has use the token exchanged new token before. The token be hacked, delete records by user_id and response with alert information.
        if not found record, user need login again or only input password.
    when use changed the password or login out, delete record by user id.

To use token continuously ,both legal user and hacker need exchange new token continuously, but only one can succeed, when one fails, both need to login again at next exchange time.

So if hacker got the token, it can be used for a short time, but can't exchange for a new one if a legal user exchanged new one next time, because the token validity period is short. It is more secure this way.

If there is no hacker, normal user also need exchange new token periodically ,such as every 30 minutes, this is just like login automatically. The extra load is not high and we can adjust expire time for our application.
